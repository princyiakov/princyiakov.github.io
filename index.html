								<h2>Testimonials</h2>

							<h3><a href="https://fr.linkedin.com/in/jmjohnmathews">Jean Marie John Mathews, Co-Founder-Giskard, Paris</a></h3>

							<p>"I had the pleasure of working with Princy at Giskard. During our time working together,
								Princy consistently demonstrated an exceptional level of professionalism and dedication
								to her work. She was always curious to learn more and took initiative to improve our
								application with her ideas and suggestions.

								She was responsible for writing important codes for our tests which would detect bias
								and performance of the models. She's intelligent and honest, and she had the ability to
								bring the team together for a common purpose. As a data scientist, she would give her
								best to understand the requirements and had the ability to put through her concerns and
								doubts to get to the core understanding of the issue. Her ability to analyse and interpret
								data, and to communicate findings in a clear and concise manner, has proven invaluable in
								our projects.

								Moreover, Princy is a dedicated team player who consistently goes above and beyond to
								ensure the success of our projects. She is able to collaborate effectively with colleagues
								from diverse backgrounds, and is always willing to share her knowledge and expertise to
								support the team's goals. Her skills, professionalism, and dedication make her an asset
								to any organization, and I am confident that she will make significant contributions to
								any team she works with." - </p>

							<h3><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-joseph2009/">Jacob Joseph, Consultant, Capiot Software, Mumbai</a></h3>

							<p>"For the short period of an year I have worked with Princy Papachan I can confidently say I couldn't have asked her anything more.
								In that one year I not only saw her excel at the work she was given but also set an example to be strived for.
								Following her exit I took over the projects she worked on and needless to say the knowledge transfer was smooth and perfect.
								She had the knack to put across critical points with crystal clarity in a way that others often looked upto.
								A rare mix of mentoring and camaraderie in one I certainly miss working with her. I can see only positive prediction in her career trajectory" - </p>
